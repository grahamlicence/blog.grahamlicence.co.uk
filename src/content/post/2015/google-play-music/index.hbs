Hmmm. I don't think Spotify is for me. 

Obviously my requirements from a music service were too high. With those niche wants like being able to play and album from start to end or being able to clear the music queue or fire up the app and not have tracks randomly appear or the current track vanish when doing so. 

Everything that makes Spotify hard to use or lacking has a support ticket - usually dating back to 2012 or 2013 - and the general feel from them is "can't be bothered." So if a paying user isn't important, you're not going to be important to me. 

So seeing that Spotify doesn't really fit what I want from a post Rdio world. So I'm giving Google Play Music or Google Music or whatever it is called a trial. I've used it and enjoyed it before - so it should be fine - and it is. I'm given a free trial and all my saved albums and playlists reappear. This is fun and is a step back in time to what I was listening to two years ago.

### How does it compare?

The app is closer to Rdio than Spotify, so finding your way around is very straight forward. All the annoyences I had with Spotify are thankfully not there.

 - You can clear the queue - and this really does feel amazing to be able to do. 

 - There is a button on the album view to play the album. In order. Just like that. 

Sonos integration is there.

The only think I can think of right now that it's missing is an api to hook in last.fm and the like but I'd take usability over missing out on that. It's not as easy to export playlists but it's not hard to do:

1, Install the [Rdio enhancer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rdio-enhancer/hmaalfaappddkggilhahaebfhdmmmngf/related?hl=en) Chrome extension. 

2, Go the Favourites and click on the Export to CSV button. You'll probably get a popup asking if the page can download multiple files - the song limit per CSV is 15,000 - and watch the files download.

3, For playlists you'll need to follow this step for each one. Go to playlist, click on the dots button and export.
